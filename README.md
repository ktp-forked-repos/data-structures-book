# Data Structures and Their Algorithms (Jayme Luiz Szwarcfiter and Lilian Markenzon)

> Solving (maybe not all) exercises from this book.

## About the book

You may have a hard time searching for it. The reason is because it's Brazilian Portuguese. [Estruturas de Dados e Seus Algoritmos](https://www.amazon.com.br/Estruturas-Dados-Algoritmos-Jayme-Szwarcfiter/dp/852161750X).

## Conventions

Everything is chapter scoped.

Files named `algorithm-*.c` are copys from the book algorithms. I'll try my best to keep them as much equals as in the book since minor changes could affect the book analysis and the questions that refer to them.

Files named `solution-*.c` are solutions as the name point.

## Table of Contents

- [Chapter 1](chapter-1/README.md)
- [Chapter 2](chapter-2/README.md)

## Contributions

This repo is a place for me to store my solutions so I must say that I do not accept contributions except for corrections (I'm a student myself, I expect making mistakes and if you could help my learning I'd appreciate).

## License

It's hard to state a license. `algorithm-*.c` are **mine** implementations of the **book** algorithms but AFAIK these algorithm came from multiple different authors. Frankly I don't know how to qualify a license here.
